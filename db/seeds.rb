# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# product = Product.new(name: "bookmark", price: 3, image_url: nil, description: "Never lose your page with this book lover's dream bookmark!")
# product.save

# product = Product.new(name: "journal", price: 21, image_url: nil, description: "Record your reading and inner thoughts. 300 pages!")
# product.save

# product = Product.new(name: "reading light", price: 14, image_url: nil, description: "Late nights look better with this reading light in hand!")
